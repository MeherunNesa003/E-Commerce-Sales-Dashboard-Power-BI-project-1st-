🛒 Ecommerce Sales Insights Dashboard

An interactive dashboard created to analyze sales, profit, and order distribution across states, categories, and payment modes, providing a clear picture of business performance.

The Ecommerce Sales Dashboard gives a visual summary of key business metrics including sales amount, profit, quantity sold, and average order value (AOV). Built for quick insights, it helps decision-makers identify regional performance, category demand, seasonal profit trends, and customer payment preferences.

The dashboard was designed using:

📊 Microsoft Power BI – For dashboard development and interactivity.

📂 Power Query – Used for cleaning and shaping raw sales data.

🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – For creating calculated fields such as profit by month and AOV.

📈 Visualizations – Bar charts, pie/donut charts, and KPI cards.

🔎 Slicers – Interactive filters for State selection, allowing users to drill down into specific regional performance.

📁 File Format – .pbix for Power BI dashboard and .png for snapshot preview.

📡 Data Source

The dataset comes from ecommerce sales records and includes:

Transaction Data: Sales amount, profit, and quantity.

Geographic Data: States (Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat).

Categories & Sub-Categories: Printers, Bookcases, Sarees, Accessories, Tables.

Time Dimension: Monthly profit tracking (Jan–Dec).
